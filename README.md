# Python-CanvasAPI-Base

A project containing many of the calls to the CanvasAPI and several other utilities, such as printing and getting data (in CSV) format.

## Getting Started

First thing you will need to do is set up the config-canvas.def file to point to your api token on your local machine. Once you have this set up properly, all you need to do is import the project into a script "import CanvasAPI" and start making calls.


## Example

There is an example script included in this project "example.py" that will print out all course data from a given course_id. Once you get this up and running, making your own scripts should be no problem.
